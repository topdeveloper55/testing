# Scenario: 

There's a simple profile page shell with an update form. 

We're using Next.js version 12 (pages directory) with tRPC. The goal is to implement a profile page with the ability to update their data. Everything is already set up and you can look up "TODO" to find where you need to fill in the details. We've left the picking the database and storage tech up to you (if you want you can also store the data locally we don't mind). 

**Acceptance criteria**
- The user should be able to partially update their profile
- The profile data should be reflected on the left hand side after the update
- If there's an error with the validation or API call the user should know what happened and how to fix it

***Bonus 1***: preload the profile data using SSR

***Bonus 2***: you host your demo

***Bonus 3***: there's Playwright e2e tests
